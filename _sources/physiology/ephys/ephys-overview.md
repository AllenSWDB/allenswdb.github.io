# Ephys

This section contains information about the electrophysiology datasets. These datasets
were collected using high-density [extracellular electrophysiology](../../background/Neuropixels-electrophysiology) probes called [Neuropixels probes](../../background/neuropixels-description). 

## Visual Coding

The [Visual Coding – Neuropixels](visual-coding/vcnp) dataset uses six Neuropixels probes to record {term}`spike`s from
a wide variety of regions in the mouse brain. Our experiments were specifically designed to
study the activity of the visual cortex and thalamus in the context of [passive visual stimulation](../stimuli/passive-visual-stimuli/visual-stimuli-list). 

## Visual Behavior

The [Visual Behavior – Neuropixels](visual-behavior/VB-Neuropixels) dataset consists of electrophysiological recordings of neural activity in mice performing a visual [change detection task](change_detection_task). Each experiment includes data from up to six Neuropixels probes recording simultaneously in cortex, hippocampus, thalamus and midbrain, while mice were exposed to different sensory and behavioral contexts, including familiar and novel stimuli, as well as active and passive stimulus blocks.

## Cell Type Look-Up Table

The [cell type look-up table](cell-type-lookup-table/ctlut-background) dataset is a collection of recordings taken from the mouse striatum with the goal of collecting a ground truth data set detailing the responses of different striatal cell types.

## Neuropixels Ultra & Psychedelics

The [Neuropixels Ultra & Psychedlics](np-ultra/npultra-psychedelics.md) dataset uses ultra-high-density neuropixels electrophysiology to probe the effects of modulating serotonergic signaling on population-scale neural activity in the cortex using the psychedelic compount psilocybin.
