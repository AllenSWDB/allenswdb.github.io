Neuropixels data processing
:::

Neuropixels probes contain 374 or 384 channels that continuously detect voltage
fluctuations in the surrounding neural tissue. Each channel is split into two
separate data streams, or *bands*, on the probes. The *spike band* is digitized
at 30 kHz, and contains information about action potentials fired by neurons
directly adjacent to the probe. The *LFP band* is digitized at 2.5 kHz, and
records the low-frequency (<1000 Hz) fluctuations that result from synchronized
neural activity over a wider area.

To go from the raw spike-band data to NWB files, we perform the following processing steps:

1. Median-subtraction to remove common-mode noise from the continuous traces
2. High-pass filtering (>150 Hz) and whitening across blocks of 32 channels
3. Spike sorting with [Kilosort2](https://github.com/MouseLand/Kilosort), to
   detect spikes and assign them to individual units
4. Computing the mean waveform for each unit
5. Removing units with artifactual waveforms
6. Computing quality metrics for every unit
7. Computing stimulus-specific tuning metrics

For the LFP band, we:

1. Downsample the signals in space and time (every 4th channel and every 2nd sample)
2. High-pass filter at 0.1 Hz to remove the DC offset from each channel
3. Re-reference to channels outside of the brain to remove common-mode noise

The packaged NWB files contain:

* Spike times, spike amplitudes, mean waveforms, and quality metrics for every unit
* Information about the visual stimulus
* Time series of the mouseâ€™s running speed, pupil diameter, and pupil position
* LFP traces for channels in the brain
* Experiment metadata

All code for data processing and packaging is available in the
[ecephys_spike_sorting](https://github.com/alleninstitute/ecephys_spike_sorting)
and the ecephys section of the AllenSDK.

## Neuropixels Opto

The Neuropixels Opto probe is based on the Neuropixels 1.0 probe, but with added optical stimulation capabilities, making it an excellent tool for optogenetic experiments. Like the NP 1.0, the NP Opto has 384 recording channels and 960 electrodes, and allow simultaneous dual-band recording in the spike band and LFP band. Unlike the NP 1.0, the NP opto also contains integrated photonic waveguides, allowing for light stimulation at 28 *emission sites* down the bottom 1400 um of the shank (14 red sites and 14 blue sites, spaced 100 um apart).

The NP Opto is hugely advantageous over more traditional laser stimulation methods, especially for techniques like optotagging. Making sure the electrode locations align with the area illuminated by the laser is a common problem when stimulating with implanted fibers or surface laser stimulation, but the NP Opto solves this issue, as the light emission sites are situated directly on the probe.
