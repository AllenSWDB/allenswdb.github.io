# Common Coordinate Framework

The Allen Mouse Brain Common Coordinate Framework ({term}`CCF`) is a 3D reference space by creating an average brain at 10um voxel resolution from serial two-photon tomography images of 1,675 young adult C57Bl6/J mice. Using multimodal reference data, we parcellated the entire brain directly in 3D, labeling every voxel with a brain structure spanning 43 isocortical areas and their layers, 314 subcortical gray matter structures, 81 fiber tracts, and 8 ventricular structures. The CCF enables the integration of data across modalities that have been registered into the common space.
