# Behavioral apparatus

Neurons in the visual system often have spatially selective receptive fields,
which means they tend to respond to stimuli shown in a particular part of visual
space. In order to repeatably show stimuli to a mouse, the mice therefore need to be
head-fixed. For all the datasets described here, this means that mice have had a
head bar that was surgically implanted prior to the experiment. For more details
about the head bar see {cite:t}`groblewski2020`.

This head-bar can be clamped into a recording setup and go back to nearly the same
location for each clamp cycle. The clamp used in these experiments does so with
< 10 Âµm precision. This level of precision is particularly important in
Ca{sup}`2+` imaging experiments, because it allows the experimenter to reliably
return to the same cells across multiple sessions. Further, in experiments that
include {term}`ISI`, it allows for targeting recordings to specified structures.

Head fixation allows two things.

First, this reliability allows the mouse to be reproducibly positioned on a rig.
For the datasets presented here, the mouse will be placed on a running wheel in
front of a screen. A set of cameras monitor the mouse's face, eye position, and
pupil size. For more information, see the
[Allen Brain Observatory white paper on Neuropixels visual coding](https://brainmapportal-live-4cc80a57cd6e400d854-f7fdcae.divio-media.net/filer_public/80/75/8075a100-ca64-429a-b39a-569121b612b2/neuropixels_visual_coding_-_white_paper_v10.pdf).

Coding 2-photon experiment, a similar one was used for all the datasets here.

A screen is positioned in the center of gaze of the mouse's right eye, which
then presents stimuli at specific locations in the mouse's field of view.

The second benefit of head fixation is that it holds the mouse's head in place to
facilitate neural recordings.
