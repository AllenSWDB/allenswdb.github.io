# Background

This section contains background information common to multiple datasets, for
example descriptions of shared techniques (*e.g.* the use of Neuropixels to
perform extracellular electrophysiology), shared behaviors (*e.g.* visual change
detection tasks), or information about the brain structures that are the focus
of multiple datasets.
