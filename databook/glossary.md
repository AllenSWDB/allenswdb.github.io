Cre line
  The Cre-lox system is a site-specific recombinase technology.. Cre-recombinase
  is a tyrosine site-specific recombinase that catalyzes the recombination of
  DNA between specific sites known as <b>loxP</b> sequences. As used in these
  experiments, Cre is used with loxP {term}`reporter` lines in order to drive
  recombinase of the loxP sites and drive the expression of the reporter. As Cre
  is often expressed within a specific gene, this allows the reporter expression
  to be restricted to particular subset of cells. [ADD A GOOD CITATION OR

CSV
  Shorthand for "comma separated values", a common file format for storing
  tabular data where each row is a line and each column is separated by a comma.

Ephys
  Shorthand for electrophysiology.

fast spiking neuron
FSN
FSI
    Fast spiking neurons are so called because of their "narrow," fast action
    potentials, specifically as seen in intracellular recordings of a cell in
    response to a prolonged step of current. Additionally, with sufficient
    current injection fast spiking neurons exhibit fast spike rates, and do
    not show frequency adaptation, or slowing of spike rates, over time. In
    unlabeled extracellular recordings, units with narrow action potentials are
    also referred to as fast spiking neurons. This feature is sometimes used
    to putatively label neurons with narrow spikes as particular cell types,
    such as {term}`PV+ neuron`s, among others.

GABA
  Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the
  mammalian brain. In cortex, most GABAergic neurons are local interneurons.

GCaMP
  A family of fluorescent proteins that are engineered to fluoresce when they
  are bound to calcium. GCaMP was generated by a fusion of the calcium binding
  domain of the calmodulin protein with green fluorescent protein (GFP). In
  these data we use primarily GCaMP6f as well as some GCaMP6s, fast and slow
  variants respectively. These two variants differ in their sensitivity as well
  as their kinetics - primarily with regards to their decay. [ADD CITATION]

HVA
  A <b>higher visual area</b> is a term for cortical visual areas that are not
  primary visual cortex, thought to be higher in the visual pathway. These
  include: VISl, VIsal, VISpm, VISam, VISrl among others

Neuropixels
  A family of devices for obtaining high channel count single unit extracellular
  recordings created through a collaborative open science project funded by
  Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Gatsby Charitable Trust, the Wellcome Trust,
  and the Allen Institute. These devices utilize modern integrated circuit
  design to miniaturize aspects of electrophysiology, enabling recordings of
  hundred of single units from a single probe with minimal brain damage. [ADD
  CITATION]

Ophys
  Shorthand for optical physiology, often in reference to {term}`Two-photon calcium imaging`.

parvalbumin-positive interneuron
PV+ neuron
    Fast spiking neurons, also known as fast spiking interneurons, is a
    short-hand for parvalbumin positive GABA-ergic inhibitory interneurons found
    in many brain regions that have strong inhibitory effects on neighboring
    cells. In experimental preparations where the genetic identity of neurons
    can be paired with electrophysiological recordings, PV+ neurons have short
    action potentials, occasionally less than 400 µS.

Primary visual cortex
V1
VISp
  The largest visual area in cortex that receives inputs from the Lateral
  geniculate nucleus of thalamus. Often refered to as <b>V1</b> or <b>VISp</b>.

Pyramidal cell
  A type of excitatory neuron with a characteristic cell body shape and apical
  dendrite. In visual cortex, pyramidal cells are by far the most common type of
  excitatory neuron.

interneuron
local interneuron
  An interneuron is a neuron that has both axonal and dendritic processes
  entirely within the same brain region. In the cortex the term is often used to
  refer to inhibitory interneurons.

local field potential
LFP
  Transient electrical potential generated in nervous tissue by the summed
  activity of cells in that tissue. This is typically measured in a lower
  temporal-frequency band of less than 250 Hz.

Basket cell
  A type of inhibitory neuron whose synaptic output targets the cell body and
  proximal dendrites of excitatory neurons. Many basket cells express the
  molecular marker parvalbumin (PV), but not all basket cells are PV+: some
  express molecules such as cholecystokinin (CCK). PV basket cells are typically
  fast spiking compared to other neurons and are thought to be important for
  gain control of network activity and setting the temporal precision of network
  activity.

Somatostatin cell
  A type of interneuron expressing the molecular marker somatostatin (SST, or
  sometimes SOM). SST cells tend to target the distal dendrites of excitatory
  neurons, and have important roles in regulating the activity of excitatory
  neurons.

Martinotti cell
  A Martinotti cell is a particular subtype of SST cell that targets the apical
  dendrites of pyramidal cells in layer 1. Martinotti cells are found in layer
  2/3 and layer 5.

Minnie Column
  A colloquial name for the 100 micron by 100 micron square column of cortex
  targeted for the census across layers. This column is a particularly well
  proofread collection of cells.

Minnie Dataset
  A colloquial name for the millimeter-scale MICrONs electron microscopy dataset.

VIP cell
  A type of interneuron expressing the molecular marker VIP. VIP cells tend to
  target other interneurons rather than excitatory neurons. This role as a
  "disinhibitory specialist" is thought to be important for \ context-dependent
  modulation of cortical activity. Many VIP cells have a characteristic bipolar
  axon that points along the axis of the cortical column and are thus often
  called "bipolar cells".

Bipolar cell
  A subset of VIP cell with a bipolar dendritic arbor. See {term}`VIP cell`.

Neurogliaform cell
  A type of interneuron that makes a diffuse axonal arbor and is thought to release {term}`GABA` through both synaptic release and volume transmission, non-selectively inhibiting neurons nearby.

regular spiking neuron
RS
  Neurons that, when injected with a long step of current in the context of
  intracellular recordings, show spike frequency adaptation where the rate of
  spiking decreases over time. These neurons also have longer (or wider) action
  potentials, and lower spike rates even when injected with large currents due
  to hyperpolarization after each action potential. These are the most common
  type of neurons in the mammalian cortex, and are often associated excitatory
  neurons. In extracellular recordings, neurons with longer action potentials
  are also sometimes referred to as regular spiking neurons, a feature which is
  used to associate these units with specific cell types, such as excitatory
  pyramidal neurons among others.


Reporter
  definition here

ROI
  A <b>region of interest</b> that is identified in a two photon calcium imaging movie. This is a mask containing pixels thought to belong to a neuron.

Spatial frequency
  How often sinusoidal components of as signal or structure repeat per unit of distance.

Targeted structure
  The brain region where data was collected from.

Temporal frequency
  How many complete periods the signal goes through for a given unit of time.

Transgenic line
  A mouse line whose genome has been altered by the introduction of one or more
  foreign DNA sequences. For these contexts, this typical involves using
  {term}`Cre line`s to drive the expression of a {term}`reporter` within a
  specific subset of cells.

Two-photon calcium imaging
  A term for techniques which measure neural activity of neurons by measuring a
  fluorescent calcium indicator. These indicators are usually a protein expressed
  in a cell, and in some cases are genetically encoded, such as {term}`GCaMP`. At
  rest a neuron has low levels of calcium, and when the neuron spikes calcium
  flows into the neuron and raises the level of calcium. [add details about two
  photon imaging. Add citation to a review]

waveform
  In a system neuroscience setting, this often refers to the voltage over time
  measured with an electrode when an individual neuron produces an action
  potential.
