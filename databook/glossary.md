Cre line
  The Cre-lox system is a site-specific recombinase technology.. Cre-recombinase
  is a tyrosine site-specific recombinase that catalyzes the recombination of
  DNA between specific sites known as <b>loxP</b> sequences. As used in these
  experiments, Cre is used with loxP {term}`reporter` lines in order to drive
  recombinase of the loxP sites and drive the expression of the reporter. As Cre
  is often expressed within a specific gene, this allows the reporter expression
  to be restricted to particular subset of cells. [ADD A GOOD CITATION OR

Driver line
  A general term for transgenic mouse lines that are engineered to label a 
  specific cell type or cell population by expressing a specific gene under
  the control of the promoter for the cell type or cell population of interest. 
  A {term}`Cre line` is a common type of Driver line that allows specific 
  genes to be expressed when crossed with a {term}`Reporter line`. 
  The driver line determines what cell population is targeted, and the 
  reporter line determines what will be expressed in that specific cell population
  (for example, GFP, GCaMP, or Channelrhodopsin).

CSV
  Shorthand for "comma separated values", a common file format for storing
  tabular data where each row is a line and each column is separated by a comma.

Ephys
  Shorthand for electrophysiology.

fast spiking neuron
FSN
FSI
    Fast spiking neurons are so called because of their "narrow," fast action
    potentials, specifically as seen in intracellular recordings of a cell in
    response to a prolonged step of current. Additionally, with sufficient
    current injection fast spiking neurons exhibit fast spike rates, and do
    not show frequency adaptation, or slowing of spike rates, over time. In
    unlabeled extracellular recordings, units with narrow action potentials are
    also referred to as fast spiking neurons. This feature is sometimes used
    to putatively label neurons with narrow spikes as particular cell types,
    such as {term}`PV+ neuron`s, among others.

GABA
  Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the
  mammalian brain. In cortex, most GABAergic neurons are local interneurons.

GCaMP
  A family of fluorescent proteins that are engineered to fluoresce when they
  are bound to calcium. GCaMP was generated by a fusion of the calcium binding
  domain of the calmodulin protein with green fluorescent protein (GFP). In
  these data we use primarily GCaMP6f as well as some GCaMP6s, fast and slow
  variants respectively. These two variants differ in their sensitivity as well
  as their kinetics - primarily with regards to their decay. 
  See this paper for more information: https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12354

Higher visual area
HVA
  A <b>higher visual area</b> is a term for cortical visual areas that receive input from the
  primary visual cortex, thus considered to be "higher" in the visual hierarchy. In primates, 
  higher visual areas include V2, V3, V4, V5, MT, etc. In the mouse, higher visual areas 
  include: VISl, VIsal, VISpm, VISam, VISrl among others. See here on a review on the function
  and connectivity of mouse visual cortex: https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-vision-102016-061331

Neuropixels
  A family of devices for obtaining high channel count single unit extracellular
  recordings created through a collaborative open science project funded by
  Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Gatsby Charitable Trust, the Wellcome Trust,
  and the Allen Institute. These devices utilize modern integrated circuit
  design to miniaturize aspects of electrophysiology, enabling recordings of
  hundred of single units from a single probe with minimal brain damage. 
  Paper describing neuropixels probes: https://doi.org/10.1038/nature24636

Ophys
  Shorthand for optical physiology, often in reference to {term}`Two-photon calcium imaging`.

Optogenetics
  A method for controlling the activity of neurons by expressing light activated ion channels
  (using a {term}`Reporter line` ) in a specific subpopulation of cells (using a {term}`Driver line`)
  to enable termporally precise control of neural spiking. Spiking can be suppressed or enhanced
  using different types of reporters. See here for a review on optogenetics as a method: 
  https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.f.325


parvalbumin-positive interneuron
PV+ neuron
    Fast spiking neurons, also known as fast spiking interneurons, is a
    short-hand for parvalbumin positive GABA-ergic inhibitory interneurons found
    in many brain regions that have strong inhibitory effects on neighboring
    cells. In experimental preparations where the genetic identity of neurons
    can be paired with electrophysiological recordings, PV+ neurons have short
    action potentials, occasionally less than 400 µS.

Primary visual cortex
V1
VISp
  The largest visual area in cortex that receives inputs from the Lateral
  geniculate nucleus of thalamus. Often refered to as <b>V1</b> or <b>VISp</b>.

Pyramidal cell
  A type of excitatory neuron with a characteristic cell body shape and apical
  dendrite. In visual cortex, pyramidal cells are by far the most common type of
  excitatory neuron.

interneuron
local interneuron
  An interneuron is a neuron that has both axonal and dendritic processes
  entirely within the same brain region. In the cortex the term is often used to
  refer to inhibitory interneurons.

local field potential
LFP
  Transient electrical potential generated in nervous tissue by the summed
  activity of cells in that tissue. This is typically measured in a lower
  temporal-frequency band of less than 250 Hz.

Basket cell
  A type of inhibitory neuron whose synaptic output targets the cell body and
  proximal dendrites of excitatory neurons. Many basket cells express the
  molecular marker parvalbumin (PV), but not all basket cells are PV+: some
  express molecules such as cholecystokinin (CCK). PV basket cells are typically
  fast spiking compared to other neurons and are thought to be important for
  gain control of network activity and setting the temporal precision of network
  activity.

Somatostatin cell
  A type of interneuron expressing the molecular marker somatostatin (SST, or
  sometimes SOM). SST cells tend to target the distal dendrites of excitatory
  neurons, and have important roles in regulating the activity of excitatory
  neurons.

Martinotti cell
  A Martinotti cell is a particular subtype of SST cell that targets the apical
  dendrites of pyramidal cells in layer 1. Martinotti cells are found in layer
  2/3 and layer 5.

Minnie Column
  A colloquial name for the 100 micron by 100 micron square column of cortex
  targeted for the census across layers. This column is a particularly well
  proofread collection of cells.

Minnie Dataset
  A colloquial name for the millimeter-scale MICrONs electron microscopy dataset.

VIP cell
  A type of interneuron expressing the molecular marker VIP. VIP cells tend to
  target other interneurons rather than excitatory neurons. This role as a
  "disinhibitory specialist" is thought to be important for \ context-dependent
  modulation of cortical activity. Many VIP cells have a characteristic bipolar
  axon that points along the axis of the cortical column and are thus often
  called "bipolar cells".

Bipolar cell
  A subset of VIP cell with a bipolar dendritic arbor. See {term}`VIP cell`.

Neurogliaform cell
  A type of interneuron that makes a diffuse axonal arbor and is thought to release {term}`GABA` through both synaptic release and volume transmission, non-selectively inhibiting neurons nearby.

regular spiking neuron
RS
  Neurons that, when injected with a long step of current in the context of
  intracellular recordings, show spike frequency adaptation where the rate of
  spiking decreases over time. These neurons also have longer (or wider) action
  potentials, and lower spike rates even when injected with large currents due
  to hyperpolarization after each action potential. These are the most common
  type of neurons in the mammalian cortex, and are often associated excitatory
  neurons. In extracellular recordings, neurons with longer action potentials
  are also sometimes referred to as regular spiking neurons, a feature which is
  used to associate these units with specific cell types, such as excitatory
  pyramidal neurons among others.

Reporter line
  A <b>reporter line</b> is a transgenic mouse line that is engineered to express a specific
  protein that enables monitoring or manipulation of neural activity (such as GFP, GCaMP, or Channelrhodopsin)
  under the control of cre or FLP recominase, or a tetracycline transactivator system. 
  The gene engineered into the reporter line will not be expressed unless the protein 
  that controls reporter gene expression (such as cre or FLP) is present, such as by
  breeding a mouse from the reporter line with a mouse from a specific {term}`Driver line` 
  that expresses the control protein. Injecting a virus that delivers cre or FLP in a 
  cell type specific manner can also trigger the expression of the reporter gene.  

Retinotopy
  <b>retinotopy</b> refers to the mapping of visual space on to neural space. 
  Most visual areas of the brain contain an orderly map of visual space such that 
  neighboring regions in space are represented by neighboring regions in the brain.
  Retinotopic maps are typically measured in terms of altitude (aka vertical retinotopy),
  referring to the axis from upper to lower visual field, and and azimuth
  (aka horizontal retinotopy), referring to the axis from left to right in space.

ROI
  A <b>region of interest</b> is a general term that describes a subregion of an image. 
  When used in reference to two photon calcium imaging, an ROI is the mask containing pixels thought to belong to a single neuron.

Spatial frequency
  How often sinusoidal components of as signal or structure repeat per unit of distance.
  When used in reference to drifting gratings, spatial frequency means the distance between the 
  bars of the grating. Typically measured as cycles per degree. 

Targeted structure
  The brain region where data was collected from.

Temporal frequency
  How many complete periods the signal goes through for a given unit of time.
  Typically measured in Hertz.

Transgenic line
  A mouse line whose genome has been altered by the introduction of one or more
  foreign DNA sequences. For these contexts, this typical involves using
  {term}`Cre line`s to drive the expression of a {term}`reporter` within a
  specific subset of cells.

Two-photon calcium imaging
  A term for techniques which measure neural activity of neurons by measuring a
  fluorescent calcium indicator. These indicators are usually a protein expressed
  in a cell, such as {term}`GCaMP`, often using a specific combination of {term}`Driver line`
  and {term}`Reporter line`s to express GCaMP in a specific subset of neurons.
  Fluorescent dyes can also be used to perform calcium imaging. At
  rest a neuron has low levels of calcium, and when the neuron spikes calcium
  flows into the neuron and raises the level of calcium, which binds to the calcium indicator
  and increases the emitted fluorescence in a specific wavelength. See here for a review
  on two-photon calcium imaging as a technique: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2006.05.019


waveform
  In a system neuroscience setting, this often refers to the voltage over time
  measured with an electrode when an individual neuron produces an action
  potential.
