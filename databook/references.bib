  abstract = {At many physiological and anatomical levels in the brain, the distribution of numerous parameters is strongly skewed with a heavy tail and typically follows a lognormal distribution.The power and frequency relationship of brain oscillations is typically expressed in a log scale.Network synchrony, measured as a fraction of spiking neurons in a given time window, shows lognormal distribution in all brain states.Firing rates, spike bursts and synaptic weights follow a lognormal distribution. Importantly, these parameters remain correlated across brain states, environments and situations.The log-dynamic patterns of networks may be supported by the lognormal distribution of corticocortical connections strengths and axon diameters.A preconfigured, strongly connected minority of fast-firing neurons form the backbone of brain connectivity and serve as an ever-ready, fast-acting system. However, full performance of the brain also depends on the activity of very large numbers of weakly connected and slow-firing majority of neurons.},

Using structure-based mutagenesis and neuron-based screening, we developed a family of ultrasensitive protein calcium sensors (GCaMP6) that outperformed other sensors in cultured neurons and in zebrafish, flies and mice in vivo. In layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons of the mouse visual cortex, GCaMP6 reliably detected single action potentials in neuronal somata and orientation-tuned synaptic calcium transients in individual dendritic spines. The orientation tuning of structurally persistent spines was largely stable over timescales of weeks. Orientation tuning averaged across spine populations predicted the tuning of their parent cell. Although the somata of GABAergic neurons showed little orientation tuning, their dendrites included highly tuned dendritic segments (5\textendash 40-\textmu m long). GCaMP6 sensors thus provide new windows into the organization and dynamics of neural circuits over multiple spatial and temporal scales.},

Currently, approaches to extracting spike times and labels from raw data are time consuming, lack standardization, and involve manual intervention, making it difficult to maintain data provenance and assess the quality of scientific results. Here, we describe an automated clustering approach and associated software package that addresses these problems and provides novel cluster quality metrics. We show that our approach has accuracy comparable to or exceeding that achieved using manual or semi-manual techniques with desktop central processing unit (CPU) runtimes faster than acquisition time for up to hundreds of electrodes. Moreover, a~single choice of parameters in the algorithm is effective for a variety of electrode geometries and across multiple brain regions. This algorithm has the potential to enable reproducible and automated spike sorting of larger scale recordings than is currently possible.},

We classify neurons on the basis of joint reliabilities to multiple stimuli and validate this functional classification with models of visual responses. While most classes are characterized by responses to specific subsets of the stimuli, the largest class is not reliably responsive to any of the stimuli and becomes progressively larger in higher visual areas. These classes reveal a functional organization wherein putative dorsal areas show specialization for visual motion signals.},

The excitation of fluorophores having single-photon absorption in the ultraviolet with a stream of strongly focused subpicosecond pulses of red laser light has made possible fluorescence images of living cells and other microscopic objects. The fluorescence emission increased quadratically with the excitation intensity so that fluorescence and photobleaching were confined to the vicinity of the focal plane as expected for cooperative two-photon excitation. This technique also provides unprecedented capabilities for three-dimensional, spatially resolved photochemistry, particularly photolytic release of caged effector molecules.}

  abstract = {To guide future experiments aimed at understanding the mouse visual system, it is essential that we have a solid handle on the global topography of visual cortical areas. Ideally, the method used to measure cortical topography is objective, robust, and simple enough to guide subsequent targeting of visual areas in each subject. We developed an automated method that uses retinotopic maps of mouse visual cortex obtained with intrinsic signal imaging (Schuett et al., 2002; Kalatsky and Stryker, 2003; Marshel et al., 2011) and applies an algorithm to automatically identify cortical regions that satisfy a set of quantifiable criteria for what constitutes a visual area. This approach facilitated detailed parcellation of mouse visual cortex, delineating nine known areas (primary visual cortex, lateromedial area, anterolateral area, rostrolateral area, anteromedial area, posteromedial area, laterointermediate area, posterior area, and postrhinal area), and revealing two additional areas that have not been previously described as visuotopically mapped in mice (laterolateral anterior area and medial area). Using the topographic maps and defined area boundaries from each animal, we characterized several features of map organization, including variability in area position, area size, visual field coverage, and cortical magnification. We demonstrate that higher areas in mice often have representations that are incomplete or biased toward particular regions of visual space, suggestive of specializations for processing specific types of information about the environment. This work provides a comprehensive description of mouse visuotopic organization and describes essential tools for accurate functional localization of visual areas.},

Higher-order sensory cortical areas, with their increasingly complex receptive fields and integrative properties, are thought to be critical nodes for this function. This is especially true in the primate visual cortex, in which functionally specialized areas are engaged in parallel streams to support diverse computations. Recent anatomical and physiological studies of the mouse visual cortex have revealed a similarly complex network of specialized higher-order areas. This structure provides a useful model for determining the synaptic and circuit mechanisms through which information is transformed across distinct processing stages. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on the layout, connectivity, and functional properties of the higher visual areas in the mouse. In addition, we speculate on the contribution of these areas to perception and action, and how knowledge of the mouse visual system can inform us about the principles that govern information processing in integrated networks.},

  abstract = {Background The Allen Institute recently built a set of high-throughput experimental pipelines to collect comprehensive in vivo surveys of physiological activity in the visual cortex of awake, head-fixed mice. Developing these large-scale, industrial-like pipelines posed many scientific, operational, and engineering challenges. New method Our strategies for creating a cross-platform reference space to which all pipeline datasets were mapped required development of 1) a robust headframe, 2) a reproducible clamping system, and 3) data-collection systems that are built, and maintained, around precise alignment with a reference artifact. Results When paired with our pipeline clamping system, our headframe exceeded deflection and reproducibility requirements. By leveraging our headframe and clamping system we were able to create a cross-platform reference space to which multi-modal imaging datasets could be mapped. Comparison with existing methods Together, the Allen Brain Observatory headframe, surgical tooling, clamping system, and system registration strategy create a unique system for collecting large amounts of standardized in vivo datasets over long periods of time. Moreover, the integrated approach to cross-platform registration allows for multi-modal datasets to be collected within a shared reference space. Conclusions Here we report the engineering strategies that we implemented when creating the Allen Brain Observatory physiology pipelines. All of the documentation related to headframe, surgical tooling, and clamp design has been made freely available and can be readily manufactured or procured. The engineering strategy, or components of the strategy, described in this report can be tailored and applied by external researchers to improve data standardization and stability.},

  abstract = {Different neuron types serve distinct roles in neural processing. Extracellular electrical recordings are extensively used to study brain function but are typically blind to cell identity. Morphoelectrical properties of neurons measured on spatially dense electrode arrays have the potential to distinguish neuron types. We used high-density silicon probes to record from cortical and subcortical regions of the mouse brain. Extracellular waveforms of each neuron were detected across many channels and showed distinct spatiotemporal profiles among brain regions. Classification of neurons by brain region was improved with multichannel compared with single-channel waveforms. In visual cortex, unsupervised clustering identified the canonical regular-spiking (RS) and fast-spiking (FS) classes but also indicated a subclass of RS units with unidirectional backpropagating action potentials (BAPs). Moreover, BAPs were observed in many hippocampal RS cells. Overall, waveform analysis of spikes from high-density probes aids neuron identification and can reveal dendritic backpropagation. NEW \& NOTEWORTHY It is challenging to identify neuron types with extracellular electrophysiology in vivo. We show that spatiotemporal action potentials measured on high-density electrode arrays can capture cell type-specific morphoelectrical properties, allowing classification of neurons across brain structures and within the cortex. Moreover, backpropagating action potentials are reliably detected in vivo from subpopulations of cortical and hippocampal neurons. Together, these results enhance the utility of dense extracellular electrophysiology for cell-type interrogation of brain network function.},

Together with anatomical and physiological methods, cell-type-specific expression of protein markers and sensors and transducers will be critical to construct circuit diagrams and to measure the activity of genetically defined neurons. Inactivation and activation of genetically defined cell types will establish causal relationships between activity in specific groups of neurons, circuit function, and animal behavior.

  abstract = {Mammalian cortex features a large diversity of neuronal cell types, each with characteristic anatomical, molecular and functional properties. Synaptic connectivity rules powerfully shape how each cell type participates in the cortical circuit, but comprehensively mapping connectivity at the resolution of distinct cell types remains difficult. Here, we used millimeter-scale volumetric electron microscopy to investigate the connectivity of inhibitory neurons across a dense neuronal population spanning all layers of mouse visual cortex with synaptic resolution. We classified all 1183 excitatory neurons within a 100 micron column into anatomical subclasses using quantitative morphological and synapse features based on full dendritic reconstructions, finding both familiar subclasses corresponding to axonal projections and novel intralaminar distinctions based on synaptic properties. To relate these subclasses to single-cell connectivity, we reconstructed all 164 inhibitory interneurons in the same column, producing a wiring diagram of inhibition with more than 70,000 synapses. We found widespread cell-type-specific inhibition, including interneurons selectively targeting certain excitatory subpopulations among spatially intermingled neurons in layer 2/3, layer 5, and layer 6. Globally, inhibitory connectivity was organized into ``motif groups,'' heterogeneous collections of cells that collectively target both perisomatic and dendritic compartments of the same combinations of excitatory subtypes. We also discovered a novel category of disinhibitory-specialist interneuron that preferentially targets basket cells. Collectively, our analysis revealed new organizing principles for cortical inhibition and will serve as a powerful foundation for linking modern multimodal neuronal atlases with the cortical wiring diagram.},

  abstract = {Extracellular electrophysiology and two-photon calcium imaging are widely used methods for measuring physiological activity with single-cell resolution across large populations of cortical neurons. While each of these two modalities has distinct advantages and disadvantages, neither provides complete, unbiased information about the underlying neural population. Here, we compare evoked responses in visual cortex recorded in awake mice under highly standardized conditions using either imaging of genetically expressed GCaMP6f or electrophysiology with silicon probes. Across all stimulus conditions tested, we observe a larger fraction of responsive neurons in electrophysiology and higher stimulus selectivity in calcium imaging, which was partially reconciled by applying a spikes-to-calcium forward model to the electrophysiology data. However, the forward model could only reconcile differences in responsiveness when restricted to neurons with low contamination and an event rate above a minimum threshold. This work established how the biases of these two modalities impact functional metrics that are fundamental for characterizing sensory-evoked responses.},

  abstract = {The brain is complex and dynamic. The spatial scales of interest to the neurobiologist range from individual synapses ({$\sim$}1 {$\mu$}m) to neural circuits (centimeters); the timescales range from the flickering of channels (less than a millisecond) to long-term memory (years). Remarkably, fluorescence microscopy has the potential to revolutionize research on all of these spatial and temporal scales. Two-photon excitation (2PE) laser scanning microscopy allows high-resolution and high-sensitivity fluorescence microscopy in intact neural tissue, which is hostile to traditional forms of microscopy. Over the last 10 years, applications of 2PE, including microscopy and photostimulation, have contributed to our understanding of a broad array of neurobiological phenomena, including the dynamics of single channels in individual synapses and the functional organization of cortical maps. Here we review the principles of 2PE microscopy, highlight recent applications, discuss its limitations, and point to areas for future research and development.},
