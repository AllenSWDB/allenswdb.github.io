  abstract = {At many physiological and anatomical levels in the brain, the distribution of numerous parameters is strongly skewed with a heavy tail and typically follows a lognormal distribution.The power and frequency relationship of brain oscillations is typically expressed in a log scale.Network synchrony, measured as a fraction of spiking neurons in a given time window, shows lognormal distribution in all brain states.Firing rates, spike bursts and synaptic weights follow a lognormal distribution. Importantly, these parameters remain correlated across brain states, environments and situations.The log-dynamic patterns of networks may be supported by the lognormal distribution of corticocortical connections strengths and axon diameters.A preconfigured, strongly connected minority of fast-firing neurons form the backbone of brain connectivity and serve as an ever-ready, fast-acting system. However, full performance of the brain also depends on the activity of very large numbers of weakly connected and slow-firing majority of neurons.},

  abstract = {Fluorescent calcium sensors are widely used to image neural activity. Using structure-based mutagenesis and neuron-based screening, we developed a family of ultrasensitive protein calcium sensors (GCaMP6) that outperformed other sensors in cultured neurons and in zebrafish, flies and mice in vivo. In layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons of the mouse visual cortex, GCaMP6 reliably detected single action potentials in neuronal somata and orientation-tuned synaptic calcium transients in individual dendritic spines. The orientation tuning of structurally persistent spines was largely stable over timescales of weeks. Orientation tuning averaged across spine populations predicted the tuning of their parent cell. Although the somata of GABAergic neurons showed little orientation tuning, their dendrites included highly tuned dendritic segments (5\textendash 40-\textmu m long). GCaMP6 sensors thus provide new windows into the organization and dynamics of neural circuits over multiple spatial and temporal scales.},

Currently, approaches to extracting spike times and labels from raw data are time consuming, lack standardization, and involve manual intervention, making it difficult to maintain data provenance and assess the quality of scientific results. Here, we describe an automated clustering approach and associated software package that addresses these problems and provides novel cluster quality metrics. We show that our approach has accuracy comparable to or exceeding that achieved using manual or semi-manual techniques with desktop central processing unit (CPU) runtimes faster than acquisition time for up to hundreds of electrodes. Moreover, a~single choice of parameters in the algorithm is effective for a variety of electrode geometries and across multiple brain regions. This algorithm has the potential to enable reproducible and automated spike sorting of larger scale recordings than is currently possible.},

We classify neurons on the basis of joint reliabilities to multiple stimuli and validate this functional classification with models of visual responses. While most classes are characterized by responses to specific subsets of the stimuli, the largest class is not reliably responsive to any of the stimuli and becomes progressively larger in higher visual areas. These classes reveal a functional organization wherein putative dorsal areas show specialization for visual motion signals.},

The excitation of fluorophores having single-photon absorption in the ultraviolet with a stream of strongly focused subpicosecond pulses of red laser light has made possible fluorescence images of living cells and other microscopic objects. The fluorescence emission increased quadratically with the excitation intensity so that fluorescence and photobleaching were confined to the vicinity of the focal plane as expected for cooperative two-photon excitation.

  abstract = {To guide future experiments aimed at understanding the mouse visual system, it is essential that we have a solid handle on the global topography of visual cortical areas. Ideally, the method used to measure cortical topography is objective, robust, and simple enough to guide subsequent targeting of visual areas in each subject. We developed an automated method that uses retinotopic maps of mouse visual cortex obtained with intrinsic signal imaging (Schuett et al., 2002; Kalatsky and Stryker, 2003; Marshel et al., 2011) and applies an algorithm to automatically identify cortical regions that satisfy a set of quantifiable criteria for what constitutes a visual area. This approach facilitated detailed parcellation of mouse visual cortex, delineating nine known areas (primary visual cortex, lateromedial area, anterolateral area, rostrolateral area, anteromedial area, posteromedial area, laterointermediate area, posterior area, and postrhinal area), and revealing two additional areas that have not been previously described as visuotopically mapped in mice (laterolateral anterior area and medial area). Using the topographic maps and defined area boundaries from each animal, we characterized several features of map organization, including variability in area position, area size, visual field coverage, and cortical magnification. We demonstrate that higher areas in mice often have representations that are incomplete or biased toward particular regions of visual space, suggestive of specializations for processing specific types of information about the environment. This work provides a comprehensive description of mouse visuotopic organization and describes essential tools for accurate functional localization of visual areas.},

Higher-order sensory cortical areas, with their increasingly complex receptive fields and integrative properties, are thought to be critical nodes for this function. This is especially true in the primate visual cortex, in which functionally specialized areas are engaged in parallel streams to support diverse computations. Recent anatomical and physiological studies of the mouse visual cortex have revealed a similarly complex network of specialized higher-order areas. This structure provides a useful model for determining the synaptic and circuit mechanisms through which information is transformed across distinct processing stages. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on the layout, connectivity, and functional properties of the higher visual areas in the mouse. In addition, we speculate on the contribution of these areas to perception and action, and how knowledge of the mouse visual system can inform us about the principles that govern information processing in integrated networks.},

  abstract = {Background The Allen Institute recently built a set of high-throughput experimental pipelines to collect comprehensive in vivo surveys of physiological activity in the visual cortex of awake, head-fixed mice. Developing these large-scale, industrial-like pipelines posed many scientific, operational, and engineering challenges. New method Our strategies for creating a cross-platform reference space to which all pipeline datasets were mapped required development of 1) a robust headframe, 2) a reproducible clamping system, and 3) data-collection systems that are built, and maintained, around precise alignment with a reference artifact. Results When paired with our pipeline clamping system, our headframe exceeded deflection and reproducibility requirements. By leveraging our headframe and clamping system we were able to create a cross-platform reference space to which multi-modal imaging datasets could be mapped. Comparison with existing methods Together, the Allen Brain Observatory headframe, surgical tooling, clamping system, and system registration strategy create a unique system for collecting large amounts of standardized in vivo datasets over long periods of time. Moreover, the integrated approach to cross-platform registration allows for multi-modal datasets to be collected within a shared reference space. Conclusions Here we report the engineering strategies that we implemented when creating the Allen Brain Observatory physiology pipelines. All of the documentation related to headframe, surgical tooling, and clamp design has been made freely available and can be readily manufactured or procured. The engineering strategy, or components of the strategy, described in this report can be tailored and applied by external researchers to improve data standardization and stability.}

  abstract = {In recent years new technologies in neuroscience have made it possible to measure the activities of large numbers of neurons simultaneously in behaving animals. For each neuron a fluorescence trace is measured; this can be seen as a first-order approximation of the neuron's activity over time. Determining the exact time at which a neuron spikes on the basis of its fluorescence trace is an important open problem in the field of computational neuroscience. Recently, a convex optimization problem involving an \$\textbackslash ell\_\{1\}\$ penalty was proposed for this task. In this paper we slightly modify that recent proposal by replacing the \$\textbackslash ell\_\{1\}\$ penalty with an \$\textbackslash ell\_\{0\}\$ penalty. In stark contrast to the conventional wisdom that \$\textbackslash ell\_\{0\}\$ optimization problems are computationally intractable, we show that the resulting optimization problem can be efficiently solved for the global optimum using an extremely simple and efficient dynamic programming algorithm. Our R-language implementation of the proposed algorithm runs in a few minutes on fluorescence traces of 100,000 timesteps. Furthermore, our proposal leads to substantial improvements over the previous \$\textbackslash ell\_\{1\}\$ proposal, in simulations as well as on two calcium imaging datasets. R-language software for our proposal is available on CRAN in the package LZeroSpikeInference. Instructions for running this software in python can be found at https://github.com/jewellsean/LZeroSpikeInference.},

  abstract = {Different neuron types serve distinct roles in neural processing. Extracellular electrical recordings are extensively used to study brain function but are typically blind to cell identity. Morphoelectrical properties of neurons measured on spatially dense electrode arrays have the potential to distinguish neuron types. We used high-density silicon probes to record from cortical and subcortical regions of the mouse brain. Extracellular waveforms of each neuron were detected across many channels and showed distinct spatiotemporal profiles among brain regions. Classification of neurons by brain region was improved with multichannel compared with single-channel waveforms. In visual cortex, unsupervised clustering identified the canonical regular-spiking (RS) and fast-spiking (FS) classes but also indicated a subclass of RS units with unidirectional backpropagating action potentials (BAPs). Moreover, BAPs were observed in many hippocampal RS cells. Overall, waveform analysis of spikes from high-density probes aids neuron identification and can reveal dendritic backpropagation. NEW \& NOTEWORTHY It is challenging to identify neuron types with extracellular electrophysiology in vivo. We show that spatiotemporal action potentials measured on high-density electrode arrays can capture cell type-specific morphoelectrical properties, allowing classification of neurons across brain structures and within the cortex. Moreover, backpropagating action potentials are reliably detected in vivo from subpopulations of cortical and hippocampal neurons. Together, these results enhance the utility of dense extracellular electrophysiology for cell-type interrogation of brain network function.},

We simultaneously imaged responses of pyramidal cells (PYR) along with parvalbumin (PV), somatostatin (SOM), and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) inhibitory interneurons in primary visual cortex while mice learned to discriminate visual patterns. Learning increased selectivity for task-relevant stimuli of PYR, PV and SOM subsets but not VIP cells. Strikingly, PV neurons became as selective as PYR cells, and their functional interactions reorganized, leading to the emergence of stimulus-selective PYR\textendash PV ensembles. Conversely, SOM activity became strongly decorrelated from the network, and PYR\textendash SOM coupling before learning predicted selectivity increases in individual PYR cells. Thus, learning differentially shapes the activity and interactions of multiple cell classes: while SOM inhibition may gate selectivity changes, PV interneurons become recruited into stimulus-specific ensembles and provide more selective inhibition as the network becomes better at discriminating behaviorally relevant stimuli.},

  abstract = {Understanding the principles of information processing in neural circuits requires systematic characterization of the participating cell types and their connections, and the ability to measure and perturb their activity. Genetic approaches promise to bring experimental access to complex neural systems, including genetic stalwarts such as the fly and mouse, but also to nongenetic systems such as primates. Together with anatomical and physiological methods, cell-type-specific expression of protein markers and sensors and transducers will be critical to construct circuit diagrams and to measure the activity of genetically defined neurons. Inactivation and activation of genetically defined cell types will establish causal relationships between activity in specific groups of neurons, circuit function, and animal behavior. Genetic analysis thus promises to reveal the logic of the neural circuits in complex brains that guide behaviors. Here we review progress in the genetic analysis of neural circuits and discuss directions for future research and development.}

  abstract = {Mammalian cortex features a large diversity of neuronal cell types, each with characteristic anatomical, molecular and functional properties. Synaptic connectivity rules powerfully shape how each cell type participates in the cortical circuit, but comprehensively mapping connectivity at the resolution of distinct cell types remains difficult. Here, we used millimeter-scale volumetric electron microscopy to investigate the connectivity of inhibitory neurons across a dense neuronal population spanning all layers of mouse visual cortex with synaptic resolution. We classified all 1183 excitatory neurons within a 100 micron column into anatomical subclasses using quantitative morphological and synapse features based on full dendritic reconstructions, finding both familiar subclasses corresponding to axonal projections and novel intralaminar distinctions based on synaptic properties. To relate these subclasses to single-cell connectivity, we reconstructed all 164 inhibitory interneurons in the same column, producing a wiring diagram of inhibition with more than 70,000 synapses. We found widespread cell-type-specific inhibition, including interneurons selectively targeting certain excitatory subpopulations among spatially intermingled neurons in layer 2/3, layer 5, and layer 6. Globally, inhibitory connectivity was organized into ``motif groups,'' heterogeneous collections of cells that collectively target both perisomatic and dendritic compartments of the same combinations of excitatory subtypes. We also discovered a novel category of disinhibitory-specialist interneuron that preferentially targets basket cells. Collectively, our analysis revealed new organizing principles for cortical inhibition and will serve as a powerful foundation for linking modern multimodal neuronal atlases with the cortical wiring diagram.},

  abstract = {Extracellular electrophysiology and two-photon calcium imaging are widely used methods for measuring physiological activity with single-cell resolution across large populations of cortical neurons. While each of these two modalities has distinct advantages and disadvantages, neither provides complete, unbiased information about the underlying neural population. Here, we compare evoked responses in visual cortex recorded in awake mice under highly standardized conditions using either imaging of genetically expressed GCaMP6f or electrophysiology with silicon probes. Across all stimulus conditions tested, we observe a larger fraction of responsive neurons in electrophysiology and higher stimulus selectivity in calcium imaging, which was partially reconciled by applying a spikes-to-calcium forward model to the electrophysiology data. However, the forward model could only reconcile differences in responsiveness when restricted to neurons with low contamination and an event rate above a minimum threshold. This work established how the biases of these two modalities impact functional metrics that are fundamental for characterizing sensory-evoked responses.},

  abstract = {The brain is complex and dynamic. The spatial scales of interest to the neurobiologist range from individual synapses ({$\sim$}1 {$\mu$}m) to neural circuits (centimeters); the timescales range from the flickering of channels (less than a millisecond) to long-term memory (years). Remarkably, fluorescence microscopy has the potential to revolutionize research on all of these spatial and temporal scales. Two-photon excitation (2PE) laser scanning microscopy allows high-resolution and high-sensitivity fluorescence microscopy in intact neural tissue, which is hostile to traditional forms of microscopy. Over the last 10 years, applications of 2PE, including microscopy and photostimulation, have contributed to our understanding of a broad array of neurobiological phenomena, including the dynamics of single channels in individual synapses and the functional organization of cortical maps. Here we review the principles of 2PE microscopy, highlight recent applications, discuss its limitations, and point to areas for future research and development.}

  abstract = {Abstract              Two-photon fluorescence microscopy has been used extensively to probe the structure and functions of cells in living biological tissue. Two-photon excitation generates fluorescence from the focal plane, but also from outside the focal plane, with out-of-focus fluorescence increasing as the focus is pushed deeper into tissue. It has been postulated that the two-photon depth limit, beyond which results become inaccurate, is where in-focus and out-of-focus fluorescence are equal, which we term the balance depth. Calculations suggest that the balance depth should be at {$\sim$}600 \textmu m in mouse cortex. Neither the two-photon depth limit nor the balance depth have been measured in brain tissue. We found the depth limit and balance depth of two-photon excitation in mice with GCaMP6 indicator expression in all layers of visual cortex, by comparing near-simultaneous two-photon and three-photon excitation. Two-photon and three-photon results from superficial locations were almost identical. two-photon results were inaccurate beyond the balance depth, consistent with the depth limit matching the balance depth for two-photon excitation. However, the two-photon depth limit and balance depth were at 450 \textmu m, shallower than predicted by calculations. Our results were from tissue with a largely homogenous distribution of fluorophores. The expected balance depth is deeper in tissue with fewer fluorophores outside the focal plane and our results therefore establish a superficial bound on the two-photon depth limit in mouse visual cortex.},
