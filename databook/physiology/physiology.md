# Physiology

These sections contain information about the physiology datasets presented during the workshop. There are three sections discussing optical physiology, electrophysiology, and the various stimuli used in the experiments. Each section contains information about the data, the experimental methologies, and the information specific to each dataset. There is also a page specific to the use of Python to access data stored in .nwb files.
