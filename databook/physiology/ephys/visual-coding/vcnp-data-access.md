# Accessing Neuropixels Visual Coding Data

## Tutorial overview

This Jupyter notebook covers the various methods for accessing the Allen
Institute Neuropixels Visual Coding dataset. We will go over how to request
data, where it's stored, and what the various files contain. If you're having
trouble downloading the data, or you just want to know more about what's going
on under the hood, this is a good place to start.

Currently, we do not have a web interface for browsing through the available
cells and experiments, as with the
[two-photon imaging Visual Coding dataset](http://observatory.brain-map.org/visualcoding).
Instead, the data must be retrieved through the AllenSDK (Python 3.8+), or via
requests sent to [api.brain-map.org](http://mouse.brain-map.org/static/api).

Functions related to data analysis will be covered in other tutorials. For a
full list of available tutorials, see the
[SDK documentation](https://allensdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/visual_coding_neuropixels.html).

This tutorial will cover the following topics:
* {ref}`content:references:access-options`
* {ref}`content:references:allensdk`
* {ref}`content:references:aws`
* {ref}`content:references:api`

(content:references:access-options)=
## Options for data access

The **`EcephysProjectCache`** object of the AllenSDK is the easiest way to
interact with the data. This object abstracts away the details of on-disk file
storage, and delivers the data to you as ready-to-analyze Python objects. The
cache will automatically keep track of which files are stored locally, and will
download additional files on an as-needed basis. Usually you won't need to worry
about how these files are structured, but this tutorial will cover those details
in case you want to analyze them without using the AllenSDK (e.g., in Matlab).
This tutorial begins with
{ref}`an introduction to this approach<content:references:allensdk>`.

If you have an **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** account, you can use an
`EcephysProjectCache` object to access the data via the Allen Brain Observatory
Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket. This is an AWS Public Dataset located at
`arn:aws:s3:::allen-brain-observatory` in region `us-west-2`. Launching a
Jupyter notebook instance on AWS will allow you to access the complete dataset
without having to download anything locally. This includes around 80 TB of raw
data files, which are not accessible via the AllenSDK. The only drawback is that
you'll need to pay for the time that your instance is runningâ€”but this can still
be economical in many cases. A brief overview of this approach can be found
{ref}`below<content:references:aws>`.

A third option is to directly download the data via **api.brain-map.org**. This
should be used only as a last resort if the other options are broken or are not
available to you. Instructions for this can be found
{ref}`at the end of this tutorial<content:references:api>`.

(content:references:allensdk)=
## Using the AllenSDK to retrieve data

Most users will want to access data via the AllenSDK. This requires nothing more
than a Python interpreter and some free disk space to store the data locally.

How much data is there? If you want to download the complete dataset (58
experiments), you'll need 855 GB of space, split across the following files:

1. CSV files containing information about sessions, probes, channels and units
   (58.1 MB)
2. NWB files containing spike times, behavior data, and stimulus information for
   each session (146.5 GB total, min file size = 1.7 GB, max file size = 3.3 GB)
3. NWB files containing LFP data for each probe (707 GB total, min file size =
   0.9 GB, max file size = 2.7 GB)

Before downloading the data, you must decide where the `manifest.json` file
lives. This file serves as the map that guides the `EcephysProjectCache` object
to the file locations.

When you initialize a local cache for the first time, it will create the
manifest file at the path that you specify. This file lives in the same
directory as the rest of the data, so make sure you put it somewhere that has
enough space available.

When you need to access the data in subsequent analysis sessions, you should
point the `EcephysProjectCache` object to an *existing* `manifest.json` file;
otherwise, it will try to re-download the data in a new location.

To get started with this approach, first take care of the necessary imports:

```{code-cell} ipython3
import os
import shutil
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pathlib import Path

from allensdk.brain_observatory.ecephys.ecephys_project_cache import EcephysProjectCache
```

Next, we'll specify the location of the manifest file. If you're creating a
cache for the first time, this file won't exist yet, but it _must_ be placed in
an existing data directory. Remember to choose a location that has plenty of
free space available.

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Example cache directory path, it determines where downloaded data will be stored
output_dir = '/root/capsule/data/allen-brain-observatory/visual-coding-neuropixels/ecephys-cache/'
manifest_path = os.path.join(output_dir, 'manifest.json')
DOWNLOAD_COMPLETE_DATASET = True
```

Now we can create the cache object, specifying both the local storage directory (the `manifest_path`) and the remote storage location (the Allen Institute data warehouse).

```{code-cell} ipython3
cache = EcephysProjectCache.from_warehouse(manifest=manifest_path)
```

This will prepare the cache to download four files:

1. `sessions.csv` (7.8 kB)
2. `probes.csv` (27.0 kB)
3. `channels.csv` (6.6 MB)
4. `units.csv` (51.4 MB)

Each one contains a table of information related to its file name. If you're
using the AllenSDK, you won't have to worry about how these files are formatted.
Instead, you'll load the relevant data using specific accessor functions:
`get_session_table()`, `get_probes()`, `get_channels()`, and `get_units()`.
These functions return a [pandas
DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/frame.html?highlight=dataframe)
containing a row for each item and a column for each metric.

If you are analyzing data without using the AllenSDK, you can load the data
using your CSV file reader of choice. However, please be aware the columns in
the original file do not necessarily match what's returned by the AllenSDK,
which may combine information from multiple files to produce the final
DataFrame.

### Session metadata

Let's take a closer look at what's in the `sessions.csv` file:

```{code-cell} ipython3
sessions = cache.get_session_table()

print('Total number of sessions: ' + str(len(sessions)))
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [output_scroll]

sessions.head()
```

The `sessions` DataFrame provides a high-level overview of the Neuropixels
Visual Coding dataset. The index column is a unique ID, which serves as a key
for accessing the physiology data for each session. The other columns contain
information about:

- the session type (i.e., which stimulus set was shown?)
- the age, sex, and genotype of the mouse (in this dataset, there's only one
  session per mouse)
- the number of probes, channels, and units for each session
- the brain structures recorded (CCFv3 acronyms)

As an illustrative example, if we want to find all of recordings from male
Sst-Cre mice that viewed the Brain Observatory 1.1 stimulus and contain units
from area LM, we can use the following query:

```{code-cell} ipython3
filtered_sessions = sessions[(sessions.sex == 'M') & \
                             (sessions.full_genotype.str.find('Sst') > -1) & \
                             (sessions.session_type == 'brain_observatory_1.1') & \
                             (['VISl' in acronyms for acronyms in
                               sessions.ecephys_structure_acronyms])]

filtered_sessions.head()
```

The `filtered_sessions` table contains the three sessions that meet these
criteria.

The code above uses standard syntax for filtering pandas DataFrames. If this is
unfamiliar to you, we strongly recommend reading through the [pandas
documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/). The AllenSDK
makes heavy use of pandas objects, so we don't have to come up with our own
functions for working with tabular data.

The `sessions` DataFrame contains much of the basic information needed to
interpret the Visual Coding dataset. Below we demonstrate a few of these.

Number of units recorded in individual sessions:

```{code-cell} ipython3
print('Found {} sessions'.format(sessions.shape[0]))
print('Descriptive statistics for unit counts from individual sessions:')
print('Mean: {}'.format(sessions.unit_count.mean()))
print('Max: {}'.format(sessions.unit_count.max()))
print('Min: {}'.format(sessions.unit_count.min()))
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline

plt.hist(sessions.unit_count, bins=20);
_ = plt.xlabel("Unit count")
_ = plt.ylabel("# sessions")
```

Genotypes of mice used in this dataset, and number of sessions available for
each genotype:

```{code-cell} ipython3
sessions.full_genotype.value_counts()
```

Types of sessions:

```{code-cell} ipython3
sessions.session_type.value_counts()
```

[CCFv3 acronyms of brain structures](http://atlas.brain-map.org/atlas?atlas=602630314)
where the data were recorded:

```{code-cell} ipython3
all_areas = []
for index,row in sessions.iterrows():
    for a in row.ecephys_structure_acronyms:
        if a not in all_areas:
            all_areas.append(a)

print(all_areas)
```

Number of sessions that have data from a given brain region (*e.g.* VISp):

```{code-cell} ipython3
count=0
for index,row in sessions.iterrows():
    if 'VISp' in row.ecephys_structure_acronyms:
        count+=1
print(count)
```

### Probe metadata

Let's take a look at another DataFrame, extracted from the `probes.csv` file.

```{code-cell} ipython3
probes = cache.get_probes()

print('Total number of probes: ' + str(len(probes)))

probes.head()
```

The `probes` DataFrame contains information about the Neuropixels probes used
across all recordings. Each row represents one probe from one recording session,
even though the physical probes may have been used in multiple sessions. Some of
the important columns are:

* `ecephys_session_id`: the index column of the `sessions` table
* `sampling_rate`: the sampling rate (in Hz) for this probe's spike band; note
  that each probe has a unique sampling rate around 30 kHz. The small variations
  in sampling rate across probes can add up to large offsets over time, so it's
  critical to take these differences into account. However, all of the data you
  will interact with has been pre-aligned to a common clock, so this value is
  included only for reference purposes.
* `lfp_sampling_rate`: the sampling rate (in Hz) for this probe's LFP band NWB
  files, after 2x downsampling from the original rate of 2.5 kHz
* `name`: the probe name is assigned based on the location of the probe on the
  recording rig. This is useful to keep in mind because probes with the same
  name are always targeted to the same cortical region and enter the brain from
  the same angle (`probeA` = AM, `probeB` = PM, `probeC` = V1, `probeD` = LM,
  `probeE` = AL, `probeF` = RL). However, the targeting is not always accurate,
  so the actual recorded region may be different.
* `phase`: the data may have been generated by one of two "phases" of
  Neuropixels probes. **3a** = prototype version; **PXI** = publicly available
  version ("Neuropixels 1.0"). The two phases should be equivalent from the
  perspective of data analysis, but there may be differences in the noise
  characteristics between the two acquisition systems.
* `channel_count`: the number of channels with spikes or LFP data (maximum =
  384)

### Electrode channel metadata

The `channels.csv` file contains information about each of these channels.

```{code-cell} ipython3
channels = cache.get_channels()

print('Total number of channels: ' + str(len(channels)))

channels.head()
```

The most important columns in the `channels` DataFrame concern each channel's
location in physical space. Each channel is associated with a location along the
probe shank (`probe_horizontal_position` and `probe_vertical_position`), and may
be linked to a coordinate in the Allen Common Coordinate framework (if CCF
registration is available for that probe).

The information about channel location will be merged into the `units`
DataFrame, which is loaded from `units.csv`:

### Unit metadata

```{code-cell} ipython3
units = cache.get_units()

print('Total number of units: ' + str(len(units)))
```

This DataFrame contains metadata about the available units across all sessions.
By default, the AllenSDK applies some filters to this table and only returns
units above a particular quality threshold.

The default filter values are as follows:

- `isi_violations` < 0.5
- `amplitude_cutoff` < 0.1
- `presence_ratio` > 0.9

For more information about these quality metrics and how to interpret them,
please refer to {doc}`this tutorial<vcnp-quality-metrics>`.

If you want to see _all_ of the available units, it's straightfoward to disable
the quality metrics filters when retrieving this table:

```{code-cell} ipython3
units = cache.get_units(amplitude_cutoff_maximum = np.inf,
                        presence_ratio_minimum = -np.inf,
                        isi_violations_maximum = np.inf)

print('Total number of units: ' + str(len(units)))
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
units.head()
```

As you can see, the number of units has increased substantially, but some
fraction of these units will be incomplete or highly contaminated. Understanding
the meaning of these metrics is a critical part of analyzing the Neuropixels
dataset, so we strongly recommend learning how to interpret them correctly.

#### Stimulus-specific unit metadata

In addition to the quality metrics, there are a number of stimulus-specific
metrics that are computed for each unit. These are not downloaded by default,
but are accessed via a separate SDK function:

```{code-cell} ipython3
analysis_metrics1 = cache.get_unit_analysis_metrics_by_session_type('brain_observatory_1.1')

analysis_metrics2 = cache.get_unit_analysis_metrics_by_session_type('functional_connectivity')

print(str(len(analysis_metrics1)) + ' units in table 1')
print(str(len(analysis_metrics2)) + ' units in table 2')
```

This will download two additional files,
`brain_observatory_1.1_analysis_metrics.csv` and
`functional_connectivity_analysis_metrics.csv`, and load them as pandas
DataFrames. Note that the total length of these DataFrames is around 40k units,
because the default quality metric thresholds have been applied.

To load _all_ of the available units, and create one giant table of metrics, you
can use the following code:

```{code-cell} ipython3
analysis_metrics1 = cache.get_unit_analysis_metrics_by_session_type(
    'brain_observatory_1.1',
    amplitude_cutoff_maximum = np.inf,
    presence_ratio_minimum = -np.inf,
    isi_violations_maximum = np.inf
)

analysis_metrics2 = cache.get_unit_analysis_metrics_by_session_type(
    'functional_connectivity',
    amplitude_cutoff_maximum = np.inf,
    presence_ratio_minimum = -np.inf,
    isi_violations_maximum = np.inf
)

all_metrics = pd.concat([analysis_metrics1, analysis_metrics2], sort=False)

print(str(len(all_metrics)) + ' units overall')
```

The length of this DataFrame should match that of the `units` DataFrame we
retrieved earlier. A few things to note about this DataFrame:

- The unit analysis metrics DataFrame _also_ includes all quality metrics, so
  it's a superset of the `units` DataFrame
- Since some of the stimuli in the `brain_observatory_1.1` session are not
  present in the `functional_connectivity` session, many of the data points in
  the unit analysis metrics DataFrame will be filled with `nan` values

### Data for individual sessions

Assuming you've found a session you're interested in analyzing in more detail,
it's now time to download the data. This is as simple as calling
`cache.get_session_data()`, with the `session_id` as input. This method will
check the cache for an existing NWB file and, if it's not present, will
automatically download it for you.

Each NWB file can be upwards of 2 GB, so please be patient while it's
downloading!

As an example, let's look at one of the sessions we selected earlier, disabling
the default unit quality metrics filters:

```{code-cell} ipython3
session = cache.get_session_data(filtered_sessions.index.values[0],
                                 isi_violations_maximum = np.inf,
                                 amplitude_cutoff_maximum = np.inf,
                                 presence_ratio_minimum = -np.inf
                                )

print([attr_or_method for attr_or_method in dir(session) if attr_or_method[0] != '_'])
```

As you can see, the `session` object has a lot of attributes and methods that
can be used to access the underlying data in the NWB file. Most of these will be
touched on in other tutorials, but for now we will look at the only one that is
capable of triggering additional data downloads, `get_lfp()`.

In general, each NWB file is meant to be a self-contained repository of data for
one recording session. However, for the Neuropixels data, we've broken with
convention a bit in order to store LFP data in separate files. If we hadn't done
this, analyzing one session would require an initial 15 GB file download. Now,
the session is broken up in to ~2 GB chunks..

Once you have created a `session` object, downloading the LFP data is simple
(but may be slow):

```python
probe_id = session.probes.index.values[0]

lfp = session.get_lfp(probe_id)
```



Tips for analyzing LFP data can be found in {doc}`this tutorial<vcnp-lfp>`.



### Downloading the complete dataset

Analyzing one session at a time is nice, but in many case you'll want to be able
to query across the whole dataset. To fill your cache with all available data,
you can use a `for` loop like the one below. Note that we've added some checks
to ensure that the complete file is present, in case the download has been
interrupted due to an unreliable connection.

Before running this code, please make sure that you have enough space available
in your cache directory. You'll need around 855 GB for the whole dataset, and
147 GB if you're not downloading the LFP data files.

```python
if DOWNLOAD_COMPLETE_DATASET:
    for session_id, row in sessions.iterrows():

        truncated_file = True
        directory = os.path.join(output_dir + '/session_' + str(session_id))

        while truncated_file:
            session = cache.get_session_data(session_id)
            try:
                print(session.specimen_name)
                truncated_file = False
            except OSError:
                shutil.rmtree(directory)
                print(" Truncated spikes file, re-downloading")

        for probe_id, probe in session.probes.iterrows():

            print(' ' + probe.description)
            truncated_lfp = True

            while truncated_lfp:
                try:
                    lfp = session.get_lfp(probe_id)
                    truncated_lfp = False
                except OSError:
                    fname = directory + '/probe_' + str(probe_id) + '_lfp.nwb'
                    os.remove(fname)
                    print("  Truncated LFP file, re-downloading")
                except ValueError:
                    print("  LFP file not found.")
                    truncated_lfp = False
```

## Accessing data on AWS



If you want to analyze the data without downloading anything to your local
machine, you can use the AllenSDK on AWS.

Follow
[these instructions](https://github.com/AllenInstitute/AllenSDK/wiki/Use-the-Allen-Brain-Observatory-%E2%80%93-Visual-Coding-on-AWS)
to launch a Jupyter notebook. Then, simply point to the existing manifest file
in the Allen Institute's S3 bucket, and all of the data will be immediately
available:

```python
cache = EcephysProjectCache(manifest=manifest_path)
```

Once your cache is initialized, you can create the `sessions` table, load
individual `session` objects, and access LFP data using the same commands
described above.

Additional tutorials specific to using AWS are coming soon.

(content:references:api)=
## Direct download via api.brain-map.org

Some people have reported issues downloading the files via the AllenSDK (the
connection is extremely slow, or gets interrupted frequently). If this applies
to you, you can try downloading the files via HTTP requests sent to
**api.brain-map.org**. This approach is not recommended, because you will have
to manually keep track of the file locations. But if you're doing analysis that
doesn't depend on the AllenSDK (e.g., in Matlab), this may not matter to you.

You can follow the steps below to retrieve the URLs for all of the NWB files in
this dataset.

```{code-cell} ipython3
from allensdk.brain_observatory.ecephys.ecephys_project_api.utilities import build_and_execute
from allensdk.brain_observatory.ecephys.ecephys_project_api.rma_engine import RmaEngine
from allensdk.brain_observatory.ecephys.ecephys_project_cache import EcephysProjectCache

rma_engine = RmaEngine(scheme="http", host="api.brain-map.org")
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
cache = EcephysProjectCache.from_warehouse(manifest=manifest_path)

sessions = cache.get_session_table()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [output_scroll]

def retrieve_link(session_id):

    well_known_files = build_and_execute(
        (
        "criteria=model::WellKnownFile"
        ",rma::criteria,well_known_file_type[name$eq'EcephysNwb']"
        "[attachable_type$eq'EcephysSession']"
        r"[attachable_id$eq{{session_id}}]"
        ),
        engine=rma_engine.get_rma_tabular,
        session_id=session_id
    )

    return 'http://api.brain-map.org/' + well_known_files['download_link'].iloc[0]

download_links = [retrieve_link(session_id) for session_id in sessions.index.values]

_ = [print(link) for link in download_links]
```

`download_links` is a list of 58 links that can be used to download the NWB
files for all available sessions. Clicking on the links above should start the
download automatically.

Please keep in mind that you'll have to move these files to the appropriate
sub-directory once the download is complete. The `EcephysProjectCache` object
expects the following directory structure:

```
cache_dir/
+-- manifest.json
+-- session_<id>/
Â¦   +-- session_<id>.nwb
+-- session_<id>/
Â¦   +-- session_<id>.nwb
+-- session_<id>/
Â¦   +-- session_<id>.nwb

```

If you aren't interested in using the `EcephysProjectCache` object to keep track
of what you've downloaded, you can create a `session` object just by passing a
path to an NWB file:

```python
from allensdk.brain_observatory.ecephys.ecephys_session import EcephysSession

nwb_path = '/mnt/nvme0/ecephys_cache_dir_10_31/session_721123822/session_721123822.nwb'

session = EcephysSession.from_nwb_path(nwb_path, api_kwargs={
        "amplitude_cutoff_maximum": np.inf,
        "presence_ratio_minimum": -np.inf,
        "isi_violations_maximum": np.inf
    })
```



This will load the data for one session, without applying the default unit
quality metric filters. Everything will be available except the LFP data,
because the `get_lfp()` method can only find the associated LFP files if you're
using the `EcephysProjectCache` object.

To obtain similar links for the LFP files, you can use the following code:

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [output_scroll]

def retrieve_lfp_link(probe_id):

    well_known_files = build_and_execute(
        (
            "criteria=model::WellKnownFile"
            ",rma::criteria,well_known_file_type[name$eq'EcephysLfpNwb']"
            "[attachable_type$eq'EcephysProbe']"
            r"[attachable_id$eq{{probe_id}}]"
        ),
        engine=rma_engine.get_rma_tabular,
        probe_id=probe_id
    )

    if well_known_files.shape[0] != 1:
        return 'file for probe ' + str(probe_id) + ' not found'

    return 'http://api.brain-map.org/' + well_known_files.loc[0, "download_link"]

probes = cache.get_probes()

download_links = [retrieve_lfp_link(probe_id) for probe_id in probes.index.values]

_ = [print(link) for link in download_links]
```
