# Stimuli

This section provides an overview of the different types of behavioral paradigms used in the datasets. 

## Passive Visual Stimuli

Passive visual stimuli are used in the [Visual Coding 2P](/physiology/ophys/visual-coding/vc2p-background), [Visual Coding Neuropixels](/physiology/ephys/visual-coding/vcnp), [V1 Deep Dive](/physiology/ophys/V1DD/V1DD-overview), and [Neuropixels Ultra & Psychedelics](/physiology/ephys/np-ultra/npultra-psychedelics) datasets. These stimuli are presented to an awake, head-fixed mouse on a running disc. There are a range of different stimuli including gratings, natural scenes and movies, locally sparse noise noise, dot motion, gabor patches that can be used in a variety of ways. 

## Change detection Behavior

The visual change detection task is used in the [Visual Behavior Ophys](/physiology/ophys/visual-behavior/VB-Ophys) and [Visual Behavior Neuropixels](/physiology/ephys/visual-behavior/VB-Neuropixels) datasets. In this go/no-go task, mice are shown a continuous series of briefly presented visual images and they earn water rewards by correctly reporting when the identity of the image changes.

## Dynamic Foraging Behavior

The Dynamic Foraging behavior is used in the [Dynamic Foraging Behavior](/dynamic-foraging/Dynamic-Foraging) dataset. For this task, thirsty, head-restrained mice perform hundreds of trials each day. A trial begins with an auditory “go” cue, after which mice have a short window in which to lick toward a leftward or rightward tube. Choices are followed by either a water reward or no outcome. Reward probabilities are assigned to each tube and vary over the course of a session.
