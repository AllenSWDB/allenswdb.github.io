Neuropixels visual stimulus sets
:::

A central aim of the Visual Coding â€“ Neuropixels project is to measure the
impact of visual stimuli on neurons throughout the mouse visual system. To that
end, all mice viewed one of two possible stimulus sets, known as
*Brain Observatory 1.1* or *Functional Connectivity*. Both stimulus sets began
with a Gabor stimulus flashed at 81 different locations on the screen, used to
map receptive fields of visually responsive units. Next, the mice were shown
brief flashes of light or dark, to measure the temporal dynamics of the visual
response.

The remainder of the visual stimulus set either consisted of the same stimuli
shown in the two-photon experiments (*Brain Observatory 1.1*), or a subset of
those stimuli shown with a higher number of repeats. We also added a dot motion
stimulus, to allow us to measure the speed tuning of units across the mouse
visual system.
