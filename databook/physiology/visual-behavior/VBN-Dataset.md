# Visual Behavior Neuropixels Dataset

The main entry point to the VBN dataset is the <code>VisualBehaviorNeuropixelsProjectCache</code> class.  This class is responsible for downloading any requested data or metadata as needed and storing it in well known locations.  For detailed info about how to access this data, check out [this tutorial](https://allensdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_static/examples/nb/visual_behavior_neuropixels_data_access.html)

We begin by importing the <code>VisualBehaviorNeuropixelsProjectCache</code>  class.

```{code-cell} ipython3
import pandas as pd
import os

from allensdk.brain_observatory.behavior.behavior_project_cache.\
    behavior_neuropixels_project_cache \
    import VisualBehaviorNeuropixelsProjectCache
```

Now we can specify our cache directory and set up the cache.

```{code-cell} ipython3
# this path should point to the location of the dataset on your platform
cache_dir = '/root/capsule/data/'

cache = VisualBehaviorNeuropixelsProjectCache.from_local_cache(
            cache_dir=cache_dir, use_static_cache=True)
```

We can use the <code>VisualBehaviorNeuropixelsProjectCache</code> to explore the parameters of this dataset. Let's start by examining the cache metadata tables.

## VBN Metadata
The data manifest comprises 5 tables: 

1. `ecephys_sessions_table` (64 kB)
2. `behavior_sessions_table` (531 kB)
3. `units_table` (130 MB)
4. `probes_table` (127 kB)
5. `channels_table` (28 MB)

The `ecephys_sessions_table` contains metadata for every <b>Neuropixels recording session</b> in the dataset. We attempted to insert 6 probes for each experiment, but occasionally individual insertions failed. The `probe_count` column tells you how many probes were inserted for a given session. The `structure_acronyms` column indicates which brain areas were targeted. For the majority of mice, there are two recording sessions. These were run on consecutive days with two different image sets, `G` and `H`. The `experience_level` column tells you whether the image set used for a particular recording was the same as the training image set (`Familiar`), or different from the training image set (`Novel`).

The `behavior_sessions_table` contains metadata for each behavior session. Some behavior sessions have Neuropixels data associated with them, while others took place during training in the behavior facility. The different training stages that mice progressed through are described by the `session_type`. 

The `units_table` contains metadata for every unit in the release. Each unit can be linked to the corresponding recording session, probe and channel by the `ecephys_session_id`, `ecephys_probe_id` and `ecephys_channel_id` columns. This table also contains a number of helpful quality metrics, which can be used to filter out contaminated units before analysis. For more guidance on how to use these metrics, check out [this tutorial](https://allensdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_static/examples/nb/visual_behavior_neuropixels_quality_metrics.html).

The `probes_table` contains metadata for each probe insertion.

The `channels_table` contains metadata for each channel recorded during an ephys session. This table provides useful info about where a particular channel is located in the Allen Common Coordinate Framework as well as it's relative position on the probe.

Now let's look at each of these tables in more detail to get a better sense of the dataset.

## Ecephys sessions table
First, let's load the ecephys_sessions_table and print the columns:

```{code-cell} ipython3
ecephys_sessions_table = cache.get_ecephys_session_table()
ecephys_sessions_table.columns
```

This table gives us lots of useful metadata about each recording session, including the genotype, sex and age of the mouse that was run, what brain areas were recorded and some important info about the stimulus. 

To demystify a few of these columns, let's briefly review the experimental design. Each mouse was trained with one of two image sets (`G` or `H`). For the majority of mice, we recorded two sessions: one with the trained 'familiar' image set and one with a 'novel' image set. Note that two of the eight images were shared across these two image sets as diagrammed below for an example mouse. For this mouse, image set `G` (images on blue and purple backgrounds) was used in training and was therefore 'familiar', while image set `H` (the two holdover images on purple background plus six novel images on red background) was 'novel'. 

![doctask](/resources/image_sets_and_training_trajectories_diagram_defaultsdk_and_unfiltered.webp)

Each recording session can be defined by a few parameters, including the `image_set` used (G or H), the `experience_level` of the mouse (indicating whether the mouse had seen the image set in previous training sessions) and the `session_number` (indicating whether it was the first or second recording day for the mouse). In bottom bubble of the above diagram, you can see the three different training/recording trajectories mice in this dataset took:

* Train on G; see G on first recording day; see H on second recording day
* Train on G; see H on first recording day; see G on second recording day
* Train on H; see H on first recording day; see G on second recording day

The numbers in the recording session cells indicate how many of each session type exist in this dataset. The first number is what the SDK returns by default. The second number (in parentheses) is what the SDK returns without filtering for abnormalities (see below as well as the [Data Access tutorial](https://allensdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_static/examples/nb/visual_behavior_neuropixels_data_access.html)).

## Behavior Sessions Table

In this dataset, mice are trained on a visual change detection task. This task involves a continuous stream of stimuli, and mice learn to lick in response to a change in the stimulus identity to earn a water reward. There are different stages of training in this task, described below. The metadata for each behavior session in the dataset can be found in the `behavior_sessions_table` and can be used to build a training history for each mouse. Importantly, this table lists all of the behavior sessions for each mouse from the beginning of its training.

Let's load the table and take a look:

```{code-cell} ipython3
behavior_sessions = cache.get_behavior_session_table()

print(f"Total number of behavior sessions: {len(behavior_sessions)}")

behavior_sessions.head()
```

You can see that there are many more sessions here than in the ecephys_sessions_table. But the columns are defined in the same way.

To see how to use this table to look at the training trajectory for one mouse, check out [this tutorial](https://allensdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_static/examples/nb/visual_behavior_neuropixels_analyzing_behavior_only_data.html)

## Units Table

The <b>units</b> metadata table contains important quality and waveform metrics for every unit recorded in this dataset. For more info about how to use these quality metrics to filter units for analysis, check out [this tutorial](https://allensdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_static/examples/nb/visual_behavior_neuropixels_quality_metrics.html)

Let's grab this table and take a look at the columns:

```{code-cell} ipython3
units = cache.get_unit_table()
print(f'This dataset contains {len(units)} total units')

units.head()
```

For more information about many of the metrics included in this table and how to use them to guide your analysis, see our [quality metrics tutorial](https://allensdk--2471.org.readthedocs.build/en/2471/_static/examples/nb/visual_behavior_neuropixels_quality_metrics.html).
