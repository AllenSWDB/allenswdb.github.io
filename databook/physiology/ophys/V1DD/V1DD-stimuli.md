The stimulus set for the V1DD data was modified from the Visual Coding stimulus in order to quickly characterize key features of the visual activity of cortical neurons. Each session (for a given mouse) used the same stimulus. (Two mice use a slightly modified version of the stimulus, see below)

## Full-field drifting gratings

## Windowed drifting gratings

## Locally sparse noise

## Natural scenes

## Natural movies
